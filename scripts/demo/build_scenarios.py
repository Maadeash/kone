Build the replay scenarios the dashboard shows.

THE OUT-OF-SAMPLE RULE
----------------------
`workflow_v2.md` §8: a replayed unit's predictions must come from the fold model
that HELD THAT UNIT OUT.  The demo never uses a model that trained on the unit it
is replaying.

That rule is enforced here rather than trusted: each bearing scenario re-runs its
own leave-one-bearing-out fold, asserts the held-out bearing is absent from the
training set, and stores the fold's own out-of-sample probabilities.  The saved
NPZ carries `out_of_sample=True` and the training-set bearing list, and
`dashboard/app.py` refuses to display a scenario that does not assert it.

WHY THE MODELS ARE RETRAINED HERE
---------------------------------
`scripts/02_train_lobo.py` saves only the deployment model (trained on all 29
bearings).  The 29 fold models are discarded after their metrics are recorded, so
a fold model has to be recreated to replay a bearing honestly.  On this CPU that
is ~2.8 min per bearing.  Using the deployment model instead would be one line of
code and would make every bearing scenario in-sample -- which is exactly the
failure the rule exists to prevent.

SCENARIOS
---------
  (a) S4 winding: inter_turn SEVERITY RAMP.  Not "healthy -> fault": there is no
      healthy D2 recording usable under a session-aware split (all three are from
      2022-01-25), so a healthy-to-fault scenario cannot be built from real data
      and is not synthesised.  The ramp walks real recordings from the lowest to
      the highest inter_turn severity on one motor.
  (b) S5 bearing: one recording per chosen bearing, replayed through the fold
      model that excluded it.  Includes a bearing the model FAILS on, because a
      demo that only shows successes is a worse demo.
  (c) S1 supply: D4 phase loss, replayed through the THRESHOLD RULE. There is no
      model to hold anything out of, so it is not marked out-of-sample -- the
      rule has no parameters fitted to any recording and the scenario says so.
  (d) S2/S3 inverter: NOT MEASURED -- no results JSON.
