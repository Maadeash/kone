"""
The one data structure every multi-stage branch sees.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Four datasets, four sets of quirks: KAIST writes one channel per TDMS segment with
per-file probe polarity that has to be detected rather than assumed; Bacha ships
10 Hz Arduino ADC integers whose published unit conversion is wrong; Thomas ships
a flat 1e6 x 9 MATLAB array with a label vector that does not carry a file index.

Adapters are the only code allowed to know any of that.  Branches only ever see a
`Recording`.  The rule is worth stating because the alternative -- a branch that
special-cases "if source == kaist" -- is how the v4 pipeline grew its leakage.

WHAT `group` MEANS, AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL
----------------------------------------------
`group` is the physical unit that must never straddle a train/test split: a motor,
a bearing, a run.  It is a required field rather than a convenience because every
honest number in this project is a group-holdout number, and the one time this
project shipped a leaky result it was because a split was made over rows instead
of over specimens (see folds.py, "THE INNER SPLIT IS THE ONE PEOPLE GET WRONG").

Making it required means an adapter author has to answer "what generalises here?"
before any model is fitted, which is the point at which the question is cheap.
